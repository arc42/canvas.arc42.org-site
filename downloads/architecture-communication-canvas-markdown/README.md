hide_title: true
---

> This is a template for a Architecture Communication Canvas (ACC, see https://canvas.arc42.org) using a code based approach with Markdown, HTML/CSS and mermaid diagrams.
>
> **Getting Started**
>
> To get started with this template, you'll need a few VSCode extensions:
>
> 1. **Markdown Preview Enhanced** - For rendering the markdown with embedded HTML/CSS
> 2. **Mermaid Preview** - For previewing mermaid diagrams
>
> You can create a `.vscode/extensions.json` file in your project root with these recommended extensions:
> ```json
> {
>    "recommendations": [
>        "bierner.markdown-mermaid",
>        "yzhang.markdown-all-in-one"
>    ]
>} 
>```
> Hint: Mermaid charts are supported by GitHub
